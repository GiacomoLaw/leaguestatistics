# League Statistics

Statistics for a specific player on LoL

## Usage

**Outdated - will be updated after various aspects have been added**

Install [Riot Watcher](https://github.com/pseudonym117/Riot-Watcher) via PIP: `pip install riotwatcher`

Place your API key from Riot in `apisettings.py`. You can get it [here](https://developer.riotgames.com/).

Run `lolstats.py`, and type in the summoner name you want. Stats for rank solo are gathered by default, more options will be added at a later date.

Make sure that the server is correct (na1 for North America). Options to choose your server will be added at a later date.

**Do not leave spaces in the summoner name, otherwise the script will glitch.**
