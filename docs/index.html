    <br />
    <p>League Statistics is a simple Python script that allows you to easily get statistics of a certain player in League of Legends on any server, using the League of Legends API. League Statistics is <a href="https://github.com/GiacomoLaw/leaguestatistics" target="_blank">open source on GitHub</a>, and please feel free to contribute if you know Python and have improvements.</p>
    <h3>Features</h3>
    <p>	• Quickly load stats for a certain player<br />
      	• Support for all servers<br />
      	• Save and load player names<br />
        • <a href="https://github.com/GiacomoLaw/leaguestatistics/labels/enhancement" target="_blank">And much more!</a></p>
    <h3>Requirements</h3>
    <p>League Statistics is tested and supported from <strong>v3.4 to the latest version of Python</strong>. It will run on those versions and above, however you may have varying mileage if you install earlier versions of Python and attempt to run it on those.
      <br /><br />
      Modules required can be found in the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GiacomoLaw/leaguestatistics/master/requirements.txt" target="_blank">requirements.txt</a> file. They are:
      <br />
      <br />	• Pick <code>pip install pick</code>
      <br />	• RiotWatcher <code>pip install riotwatcher</code>
      <br />	• Requests <code>pip install requests</code>
      <br /><br />
      Or, navigate to the download, and type <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code> to install modules according to the requirements file.
      <br /><br />
      You will need an <a href="https://developer.riotgames.com/" target="_blank">API key from the Riot Developer website</a>, which is free and easy. These last for 24 hours, but you can apply for a permanent one.
      <br /><br />
      It is recommended that you install the latest version from the <a href="https://github.com/GiacomoLaw/leaguestatistics/releases" target="_blank">releases section</a> to have a stable release.
      <br /><br />
      <strong>Important note for Windows users</strong> - As League Statistics makes heavy usage of Curse, you'll need to install Curse for Windows. To do so, type <code>pip install windows-curses</code>. Make sure you run League Statistics from command prompt or via the Python CLI, as Curses does not work in third party apps such as PyCharm.
    </p>
    <h3>Credit</h3>
    <p>League Statistics uses some third party open source modules.
      <br /><br />
      Firstly, <a href="https://github.com/pseudonym117/Riot-Watcher" target="_blank">RiotWatcher</a>. RiotWatcher is what helps League Statistics connect to the Riot API, being a Python wrapper on top of it. Without it, League Statistics could not exist. Huge thanks for the author.
      <br /><br />
      Secondly, <a href="https://github.com/wong2/pick" target="_blank">Pick</a> is what League Statistics uses to generate Curse menus. This makes it a lot easier to navigate League Statistics.
    </p>
    <h3>Support</h3>
    <p>There are numerous ways you can support. Any help to the <a href="https://github.com/GiacomoLaw/leaguestatistics/" target="_blank">repository on GitHub</a> is great help. Please make sure you check current issues and select one that is not labeled as work in progress, and comment that you are doing the issue.
      <br /><br />
      You can also support development via PayPal if you wish. Thanks for using League Statistics!
